# Washington EV Analysis

## Overview

This project provides a detailed analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption in Washington State. The analysis aims to explore the geographic distribution, growth trends, and demographic factors influencing EV adoption. By visualizing these aspects in an interactive dashboard, users can gain a deeper understanding of the current state and future potential of EVs in Washington.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: The data was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/qnqfbqfqo/electric-vehicle-population-in-washington-state), which provides detailed records of Electric Vehicles (EVs) registered in Washington State.
2. **Data Preparation**: Using Excel, the data was cleaned, filtered, and organized to ensure accuracy and relevance for the analysis.
3. **Data Visualization**: Tableau was used to create an interactive dashboard that presents key insights into EV adoption. The dashboard includes visualizations such as maps, time-series charts, and comparison graphs.
4. **Publishing**: The completed dashboard was published to Tableau Public and the project files were prepared for sharing on GitHub.

## Analysis & Insights

### Regional Distribution
The dashboard highlights the distribution of EVs across different counties in Washington. King County, home to Seattle, shows the highest concentration of EVs, reflecting the region's urbanization and environmental initiatives.

### Growth Over Time
The analysis shows a significant increase in EV adoption over recent years, especially from 2018 onwards. This trend aligns with the broader market availability of EV models and government incentives aimed at promoting clean energy.

### Demographics & Preferences
By analyzing demographic data, the project reveals that areas with higher income levels tend to have a higher percentage of EV registrations. This insight points to the current market positioning of EVs as being more accessible to wealthier individuals.

### Environmental Impact
One of the dashboardâ€™s key components is the comparative analysis of EVs against traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. The lower carbon emissions and reduced reliance on fossil fuels are clearly illustrated, emphasizing the environmental benefits of widespread EV adoption.

## Files Included

## Conclusion

The Washington EV Analysis project provides valuable insights into the current landscape of Electric Vehicle adoption in Washington State. The analysis highlights key trends, such as the concentration of EVs in urban areas and the rapid growth in recent years. The environmental impact section underscores the potential of EVs to significantly reduce carbon emissions, supporting the state's clean energy goals.

In the future, this analysis could be expanded to include data on charging infrastructure, EV market forecasts, and comparisons with other states. Such enhancements would further enrich the understanding of the factors driving EV adoption and the challenges that lie ahead.
